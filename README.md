## Project Description

The Akan Name Generator is a web-based application that calculates the day of the week a user was born using their date of birth and assigns an Akan name based on their gender.

Akan names are part of Ghanaian culture, where children are traditionally named according to the day of the week they were born. This project demonstrates the use of JavaScript fundamentals such as functions, arrays, control flow, operators, and user input validation in a real-world scenario.

Given the user enters an invalid day or month (e.g., day > 31, month > 12)
When the user clicks submit
